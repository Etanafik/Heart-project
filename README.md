This project is prepared as a training program on Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration into research and teaching for Wollega University, particularly targeting instructors in the College of Engineering and Technology and the Institute of Technology (IoT).

The training focuses on building the foundational and practical skills required to incorporate AI-driven methods into academic work. It introduces participants to data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, using the Heart Disease dataset as a practical case study. Through hands-on exercises, trainees will learn how to explore datasets, generate insights through interactive dashboards, apply selected machine learning algorithms for prediction, and conduct model performance evaluation and error analysis.

The overall goal of this project is to strengthen the digital competencies of Wollega University instructors, enabling them to integrate AI methodologies into teaching, research supervision, applied projects, and community service initiatives. The training will support the university’s broader digital transformation efforts by promoting modern AI techniques, enhancing research quality, and fostering innovation across disciplines.
